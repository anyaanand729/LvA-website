        Luis von Ahn was born and grew up in Guatemala City. When he was eight, his mother bought him a Commodore 64, which fueled his start into the field of computer science. Von Ahn earned a BS in Mathematics in 2000 from Duke and a PhD in Computer Science in 2005 from Carnegie Mellon where he later became a faculty member in 2006.

    <h1>Research and Innovation</h1>
    <p>
        Luis von Ahn first started to research cryptography and steganography, proving that private-key steganography is possible. After receiving his bachelor's degree, von Ahn worked on CAPTCHAs, which he later profited from, coining the term CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). During this early work on CAPTCHAs, von Ahn started to gain widespread fame from the media coverage. For his PhD, von Ahn coined the term "human computation" referring to the ability of humans and computers to solve problems together that neither would be able to solve separately. His PhD is also the first work on Games with a Purpose, which are games played by humans that produce useful computation as well. One of these games is the ESP Game which pairs two players randomly and shows the same image while prompting for descriptions, players gain a point for every descriptor in common. These descriptors in common get paired with the picture to create accurate generated descriptions. Google licensed this data and software for their Google image search.
